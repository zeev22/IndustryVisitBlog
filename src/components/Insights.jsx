                        Our 7-day Industrial Visit from April 7 to 13, 2025, took us through the busy streets of Manila, the hardworking shores of Subic, and the peaceful mountains of Baguio. The trip was exciting, but also tiring at times. It gave us valuable memories and helped us better understand the rich history, industries, and natural beauty of the Philippines.
                        In Manila, we felt the city's energy. We explored Intramuros with historian Maria Santos and learned about the struggles during the colonial period. Fort Santiago reminded us of the strength of the Filipino people. Rizal Park, with its green lawns and active crowds, made us proud of our country, while the Manila Cathedral gave us a peaceful place to think.
                        Subic, with its cool coastal breeze, showed us the world of industry. We visited the Subic Bay Exhibition and Convention Center (SBECC), where we were struck by the murals that beautifully depicted the history of Subic Bay. These murals highlighted the region's transformation from a military base to a thriving commercial hub, showcasing its rich cultural and historical significance. At SBECC, we also saw how industry and nature can work together, with green spaces surrounding modern buildings.
                        In Baguio, the fresh air and beautiful views gave us a much-needed break. The Bell Church, with its colorful gardens and Chinese-style architecture, made us think about cultural unity. At the Strawberry Farm, we picked fresh strawberries and enjoyed the simple joy of connecting with nature, a nice change from Manila’s fast pace. At Mines View Park, we marveled at the stunning mountain views and felt connected to the land. The Philippine Military Academy, with its disciplined students, made us think about our own goals.
                        Throughout the trip, we woke up early at 4 or 5 am and spent long hours on the bus. It was hard, but these moments brought us closer. We shared snacks and stories with classmates, listened to professors teach us about Manila’s history during traffic jams, and laughed together during bus rides.
                        The most memorable part was the trip to Baguio. The winding roads and changing views were breathtaking, and the cool breeze was a welcome break after busy days. This trip was more than just a tour; it opened our eyes to the different sides of the Philippines—its history, industries, and natural beauty. It made us appreciate our country in a new way and left us wanting to explore more in the future.
